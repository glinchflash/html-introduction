<h2 class="story">A funny story</h2>
<p class="story">After going out with 3 friends we came home at one of my friends, we decided to go for a swim in the pool.
after a few minutes we realized some of us might had a glass to much to be able to safely swim. One friend who was already out of the pool
asked us to help our fourth friend out of the pool since he clearly was incapable. Now both me and our other friend had both been drinking quite a bit ourselves.
So we discussed we would just start with putting our Fourth friend on the stairs of the pool, we pick him up with just to realize after few meters,
we were holding him upside down which explained to us quickly why he didn't cooperate at all.</p>

<h3 class="story">TL:DR</h3>
